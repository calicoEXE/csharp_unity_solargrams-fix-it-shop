# SolarGram's Fix It Shop

SolarGram's Fix It Shop is a 3D Solarpunk game where players co-manage a repair and refurbish shop with their grandmother. Players are to engage with a diverse cast of characters seeking assistance, listen to their unique stories and explore the vibrant Solarpunk world! You are to balance shop management, character interaction as you refurbish and repair the customer's belongings.

As a Systems Designer and Programmer, I managed the majority of the backend framework, including NPC spawning, item assigning, data structuring, data storage, and determining NPC urgency for visiting the shop. These framework components work cohesively, supporting each other by supplying and sharing necessary data. I also contributed in puzzle balancing for the repair gameplay. Lastly, I served as the sole UI Artist for the game. I created all the UI assets and arranged them to enhance the game's polished appearance.
